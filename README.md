# bitbarrel (wip)

Toy implementation of [bitcask](https://riak.com/assets/bitcask-intro.pdf) in `ysh`.

It's a project to see what's easy in and what's missing from `ysh` right now and what idiomatic code might look like.

## Requirements

Oils 0.23.0 (and maybe above, but needs 0.23.0 due to use of `dict->erase()`)
